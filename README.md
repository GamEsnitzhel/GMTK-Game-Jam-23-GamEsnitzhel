# GMTK 23
 
Good Morning, Gam here.

This is the repo to to my game that I made and will be submitting for GMTK Game Jam 2023.

The project was made in Godot `v4.1.rc3.official [cdd2313ba]`. (Also `Edit.bat` is the `.bat` file that I use to open the project. I meant to add it to the gitignore but apparently not.).

This game is a 2D platformer THAT STILL NEEDS THE MOUSE. I'm trying to think of a good way to have controller support here but whattdayaknow, it's difficult.

GLHF if you try to play it... or even look at this dreadful source code.
